This is a team project on C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO.

Project by: GABRIEL EFFANGHA, MARIE CLAIRE SENGA.


For this project:

	- All our codes use the betty style.
	- We are allowed to use only one global variable.
	- The prototype of all our functions are included in our header file called monty.h.
	- We came up with the solutions ourselves.
	- We are not allowed to use more than 5 functions per file.
	- All our codes are compiled using: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty.
	- All our output is printed on stdout.
	- All error messages are printed on stderr.
	- We are only allowed to use malloc and free.
